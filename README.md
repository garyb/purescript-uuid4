A library for generating, printing, and parsing version 4 UUIDs.

There is an existing [`purescript-uuid`](https://github.com/megamaddu/purescript-uuid) library that also covers v4 UUIDs, but this library is self-contained and does not require additional dependencies from `npm`.

## Installation

```
bower install purescript-uuidv4
```

## Documentation

Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](http://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-uuidv4).
