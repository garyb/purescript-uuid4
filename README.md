# purescript-uuidv4

[![Latest release](http://img.shields.io/github/release/garyb/purescript-uuidv4.svg)](https://github.com/garyb/purescript-uuidv4/releases)
![Build Status](https://github.com/garyb/purescript-uuidv4/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A library for generating, printing, and parsing version 4 UUIDs.

There is an existing [`purescript-uuid`](https://github.com/megamaddu/purescript-uuid) library that also covers v4 UUIDs, but this library is self-contained and does not require additional dependencies from `npm`.

## Installation

Install with [Spago](https://github.com/purescript/spago):

```sh
spago install uuidv4
```

Or with [Bower](https://bower.io/) for legacy projects:
```sh
bower install purescript-uuidv4
```

## Documentation

Module documentation is [published on Pursuit](http://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-uuidv4).
